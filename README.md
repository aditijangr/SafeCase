# SafeCase

**SafeCase** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Hive blockchain to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof management of digital assets, specifically images. SafeCase enables users to upload, edit, version, and authenticate images, creating an immutable history of changes. This allows users to trace edits, verify authenticity, and maintain ownership, which is crucial in a digital landscape where manipulated media can mislead, misinform, and damage trust.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain-Powered Transparency**: Leverages Hive blockchain for an immutable, transparent record of image uploads and edits.
- **Decentralized Storage on IPFS**: Stores images on IPFS, ensuring images are decentralized and tamper-proof.
- **Version History Tracking**: Each image edit is stored as a unique version, providing a clear history of changes with metadata for accountability.
- **User Attribution**: Identifies the creator of each edit, allowing credits to be accurately attributed and ensuring transparency.

## Use Cases

- **Journalists and Activists**: Securely document events, track edits, and protect evidence, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of their media.
- **Artists and Creatives**: Maintain ownership over digital work by recording each version of edits and safeguarding attribution.
- **Business and Legal Professionals**: Provide authenticated images for contracts, records, and evidence, reducing the risk of manipulation and increasing trust.
