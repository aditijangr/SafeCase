# SafeCase

**SafeCase** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Hive blockchain to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof management of digital assets, specifically images. SafeCase enables users to upload, edit, version, and authenticate images, creating an immutable history of changes. This allows users to trace edits, verify authenticity, and maintain ownership, which is crucial in a digital landscape where manipulated media can mislead and misinform.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain-Powered Transparency**: Leverages Hive blockchain for an immutable, transparent record of image uploads and edits.
- **Decentralized Storage on IPFS**: Stores images on IPFS, ensuring images are decentralized and tamper-proof.
- **Version History Tracking**: Each image edit is stored as a unique version, providing a clear history of changes with metadata for accountability.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To start using SafeCase, you need:

- HiveKeychian installed in the browser
- A Hive blockchain account.
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) installed 
### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

```bash

**Explanation of Structure**:
- Ensure there are no unclosed code blocks.
- Indented the commands under installation steps to clarify theyâ€™re separate commands.
- Added clear headers (`##`) to avoid Markdown misinterpreting the structure. 

This should prevent Markdown from incorrectly formatting sections as code.
